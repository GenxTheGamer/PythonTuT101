->It is systematic way of solving a problem by dividing the problem into several

 =Built-in Functions=

1. input function: accepts string from user without evaluating its value.
   Example-
"""
name=input("Enter a name:")
print("---------\n")
"""
2. eval function: evaluates the value of string.
  Example-
"""
eval('15+10')
print("---------\n")
"""
3. Composition function: value returned by fun may be used as an argument for another
fun in a nested manner. Its called composition.
"""
n1=eval(input("Enter a number: "))
n2=eval(input("Enter arithmetic expression: "))
